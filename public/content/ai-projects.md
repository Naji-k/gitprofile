# Learning to Build With AI: My Simple Web Games

Recently, I’ve been exploring how AI and AI agents can fit into my workflow as a software engineer. Not just as something that “writes the code for me,” but as a tool I can collaborate with while still keeping control over how a project is structured and maintained.

To practice, I built two small web games:

- **Quiz game**
- **Memory game**

- **Key Features:**
  - Mobile-friendly design
  - Persistent game state
  - Multi-language support
  - Clean code following SOLID principles

---

## Why Games?

Games are a sweet spot: simple enough to finish, but complex enough to touch on real engineering challenges—state management, reusability, user interaction, and even multi-language support.

## How I Used AI

I leaned on AI during these projects, but not in a copy-paste way. Instead, I treated it like a coding partner:

- I made all architectural decisions.
- I reviewed every piece of suggested code.
- I stuck to **SOLID principles** so I could understand, modify, and extend the projects myself.
- I maintained full understanding of the codebase.

The goal is not to let AI write my code. It's to use AI to write better code faster.

## What I Learned

- **AI is powerful, but you can't outsource your understanding.** If I just accept whatever it generates, the project quickly becomes unmaintainable.
- **Good architecture pays off.** Even small games benefit from clean design and separation of concerns.
- This approach makes me more productive without making me dependent on the tools.

- [Memory Game](http://dev.nkanounji.com/memory_game/)

They’re simple projects, but for me, they’ve been a great way to practice coding with AI—balancing assistance with real control.
